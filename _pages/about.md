Hello! I'm Sulthan Zahran Ma'ruf, a Physics graduate from Universitas Indonesia. I currently work at LG Sinarmas, an IT consulting company formed through a joint venture between LG and Sinarmas. In my role, I helped develop programming solutions for manufacturing (MES) and logistics (RTD) at the Hyundai LG Indonesia EV battery factory. I'm passionate about optimization, parallel computing, and instrumentation physics. Feel free to reach out!
